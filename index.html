            <h1>What is an operating system?</h1>
            <p>An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's
                memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate
                with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language. Without an operating system, a
                computer is useless.<br>
            </p>

    <div class="container-content">

            <h1>The operating system's job</h1>
            <p>
                Your computer's operating system (OS) manages all of the software and hardware on the computer. Most of
                the time, there are several different computer programs running at the same time, and they all need to
                access your computer's central processing unit (CPU), memory, and storage. The operating system
                coordinates all of this to make sure each program gets what it needs.<br><br>
            </P>

            <H2>Types of operating systems</H2>
            <p>
                Operating systems usually come pre-loaded on any computer you buy. Most people use the operating system
                that comes with their computer, but it's possible to upgrade or even change operating systems. The three
                most common operating systems for personal computers are Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.<br><br>

                Modern operating systems use a graphical user interface, or GUI (pronounced gooey). A GUI lets you use
                your mouse to click icons, buttons, and menus, and everything is clearly displayed on the screen using a
                combination of graphics and text.<br><br>

                Each operating system's GUI has a different look and feel, so if you switch to a different operating
                system it may seem unfamiliar at first. However, modern operating systems are designed to be easy to
                use, and most of the basic principles are the same.<br><br>

            <h1>Kernel</h1>
            <p>A Kernel is a computer program that is the heart and core of an Operating System. Since the Operating
                System has control over the system so, the Kernel also has control over everything in the system. It is
                the most important part of an Operating System. Whenever a system starts, the Kernel is the first
                program that is loaded after the bootloader because the Kernel has to handle the rest of the thing of
                the system for the Operating System. The Kernel remains in the memory until the Operating System is
                shut-down.<br><br>

                The Kernel is responsible for low-level tasks such as disk management, memory management, task
                management, etc. It provides an interface between the user and the hardware components of the system.
                When a process makes a request to the Kernel, then it is called System Call.<br><br>

                A Kernel is provided with a protected Kernel Space which is a separate area of memory and this area is
                not accessible by other application programs. So, the code of the Kernel is loaded into this protected
                Kernel Space. Apart from this, the memory used by other applications is called the User Space. As these
                are two different spaces in the memory, so communication between them is a bit slower.<br><br>

                <H2>Functions of a Kernel</H2>
                <p>Following are the functions of a Kernel:<br><br>

                    Access Computer resource: A Kernel can access various computer resources like the CPU, I/O devices
                    and other resources. It acts as a bridge between the user and the resources of the system.<br><br>

                    Resource Management: It is the duty of a Kernel to share the resources between various process in
                    such a way that there is uniform access to the resources by every process.<br><br>

                    Memory Management: Every process needs some memory space. So, memory must be allocated and
                    deallocated for its execution. All these memory management is done by a Kernel.<br><br>

                    Device Management: The peripheral devices connected in the system are used by the processes. So, the
                    allocation of these devices is managed by the Kernel.<br><br>

                <h1>Traditional Web Hosting vs. Cloud Computing</h1>
                <p>
                    Traditional Hosting vs. Cloud Hosting: Benefits and Drawbacks of Each
                    ‘Cloud hosting vs traditional hosting’ is a complicated question that depends on a variety of
                    factors
                    unique to each client. Thus, deciding whether to choose cloud hosting or traditional hosting is a
                    case-by-case basis.<br><br>

                    Although cloud hosting is a growing force in Internet storage and website creation, traditional
                    hosting
                    users should not be worried. Traditional hosting still provides a wide array of benefits that will
                    make
                    it relevant for many years to come.<br><br>

                    1. Traditional Hosting: Traditional hosting uses hosted servers to provide storage services to the
                    client. Storage servers are installed at various locations, and through the use of the Internet,
                    services are then made available to clients. There are three subcategories of traditional web
                    hosting,
                    each with its own benefits and drawbacks:<br><br>

                    Shared Hosting: Shared hosting is the most common among small businesses and is sharing the storage
                    server with multiple other websites. This kind of hosting is cheaper than other types of hosting, as
                    the
                    entire cost of a single server is divided among many clients. However, if your business is
                    expanding,
                    then you should think twice before choosing this seemingly inexpensive option because what’s saved
                    in
                    price will be lost in slower loading times and high web traffic, as there is a large number of users
                    using the same resources.<br><br>

                    Dedicated Servers: This category of web hosting is best for websites that receive 100K visitors on a
                    daily or monthly basis. With this huge amount of traffic, these websites need higher load times to
                    prevent a crash. Dedicated servers are also great for customization; you can choose every basic and
                    professional area of your server, from the amount of space to the operating system, and also the
                    hardware elements. Opting for dedicated servers allows you the desired flexibility that you need.
                    Virtual private servers (VPS): Virtual private servers or VPS can be the most balanced web hosting
                    service to upgrade to. One cool feature of VPS is that it maintains equality amongst all users
                    unlike
                    shared hosting. In other words, the VPS server will divide the resources available equally among all
                    the
                    participants. If the RAM is 20GB and storage space is 200GB, assuming that it’s limited to 10 users,
                    the
                    division will provide 2GB RAM and 20GB storage for each user.<br><br>

                    2. Cloud Hosting: Cloud computing is an entirely different ballgame than traditional hosting, but it
                    does share some characteristics with VPS Hosting. In cloud hosting, you’re allowed to use the
                    computer
                    resources rather than owning a personal server.<br><br>

                    Let’s say the VPS is restricted to 10 users each with 20 GB of space but none are able to utilize
                    that
                    completely, then the host can allow their unused space to be utilized by other websites. So, rather
                    than
                    using storage on one server, cloud computing will store your data in 10 different servers.
                    Therefore, if
                    one network is busy, you can still operate using any of the 9 other networks. This feature of having
                    different storage servers allows for a faster working of website, minimal downtime, and better
                    control
                    over your data.

                <h1>Static vs. Dynamic pages</h1>
                <p>
                    Dynamic vs. Static Websites: What's the Difference?<br><br>

                    There are essentially two types of websites: static and dynamic. However this can be confusing
                    because<br>
                    there can be static elements of a dynamic site, dynamic elements of a static site… as we continue
                    into
                    the age of Progressive Web Apps and website personalization, the lines become blurred between what’s
                    static and dynamic.<br><br>

                    What can be Static or Dynamic?<br>
                    When discussing whether a site is static or dynamic, half of the battle is determining what aspect
                    of
                    the site you’re discussing. The code of the page, delivery of the page, and the client browser can
                    all
                    be considered either static or dynamic.<br><br>

                    What’s a Dynamic Website?<br>
                    Dynamic sites use server side languages to process requests at the time it’s made and generate a
                    page
                    and its contents in real-time. This means that dynamic websites interact with the user accessing the
                    site and render content depending on the user’s actions or settings. One example of a dynamic
                    website is
                    web apps. Take Twitter as an example: when you log in, it displays content just for you.<br><br>

                    While dynamic sites are extremely powerful they are also more complex. Along with this complexity
                    are
                    many advantages and disadvantages inherent to a dynamic site build.<br><br>

                    Dynamic Site Advantages<br>
                    Powered by Databases. By connecting a dynamic site to a database, you’re able to easily request
                    information in an organized and structured way to create and display content depending on how the
                    user
                    wants to view it.<br>

                    Connect to a CMS<br>
                    This ability to connect to a database means that you can also connect to a CMS. Content stored in
                    the
                    CMS can be a variety of things, from the text to the images that are displayed, page layouts, site
                    settings, and more. This allows for extreme flexibility when building sites, and also allows for
                    multiple users to be able to manipulate content as needed.<br><br>

                    Low Ongoing Maintenance Cost<br>
                    Since you can connect a dynamic site to a CMS there are little or no ongoing costs unless there is a
                    change in the basic design or an extra capability is added to the site.<br><br>

                    Dynamic Site Disadvantages<br>
                    Design Limitations<br>
                    When generating content on a page from a database, you’re typically pulling in content and telling
                    it to
                    display a certain way, no matter what the content is. This can make design tricky, as you’ll likely
                    opt
                    for a one-size-fits-all approach. Depending on the CMS, it can be difficult to build multiple
                    designs to
                    display different types of content in different types of ways.<br><br>

                    With dynamic sites, you are forced into using templates for your page, or you are committing to
                    building
                    custom templates for every page. This is easier in some CMSes such as Zesty.io but harder to do in
                    others such as Wordpress or Drupal.<br><br>

                    Can Incur Upfront Build Costs<br>
                    When building a dynamic site, it can incur much more work upfront as you’re connecting the site to a
                    database, building the foundation for the site to generate content, etc. Additional functionality
                    may
                    also cost more as you add features to your dynamic site throughout its life. While maintenance costs
                    are
                    low for a dynamic site, they can incur much higher initial build costs than a static site.<br><br>

                    What’s a Static Website?<br>
                    Static websites are pre-rendered, typically cached, and served by a CDN. The site is pre-generated
                    by
                    individual files that are delivered to all users in the same manner. There are advantages and
                    disadvantages to choosing to build a static site.<br><br>

                    Static Site Advantages<br>
                    Flexibility<br>
                    The main advantage of a static site is the flexibility it offers. Every page can be different;
                    designs
                    can change, layouts can differ, and the designer doesn’t have to make one design fit the mold for
                    multiple types of content to display on a page.<br><br>

                    Cost<br>
                    Cost can be lower upfront to build a static site than to build a dynamic site. Since pages don’t
                    have to
                    be connected to a database to generate content and render the view, they can be less expensive than
                    a
                    dynamic site to build. However, hooking up a headless CMS to a static site generator and then a
                    delivery
                    network can make a static site expensive to build.<br><br>

                    Load Times<br>
                    Since static sites are pre-rendered, the load times are very fast. Without complex scripting, a
                    database, parsing content through templating languages, etc. these sites typically load in a
                    snap.<br><br>

                    Static Site Disadvantages<br>
                    More Difficult to Update<br>
                    Static sites can be challenging to change once they’re built- even making small content tweaks can
                    be
                    challenging. Unless you are familiar with HTML, CSS, and the code of the site, you may have to ask
                    your
                    developer who originally built the site to make changes to the site for you.<br><br>

                    More Difficult to Scale<br>
                    Adding to a static site over time can also be more difficult than with a dynamic site. For instance,
                    creating product pages means that you have to construct a new page every time you want to add a new
                    product page, which can take time and incur ongoing maintenance costs.<br><br>
