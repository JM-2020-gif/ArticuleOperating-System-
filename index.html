            <h1>What is an operating system?</h1>
            <p>An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's
                memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate
                with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language. Without an operating system, a
                computer is useless.<br>
            </p>

            <h1>The operating system's job</h1>
            <p>
                Your computer's operating system (OS) manages all of the software and hardware on the computer. Most of
                the time, there are several different computer programs running at the same time, and they all need to
                access your computer's central processing unit (CPU), memory, and storage. The operating system
                coordinates all of this to make sure each program gets what it needs.<br><br>
            </P>

            <H2>Types of operating systems</H2>
            <p>
                Operating systems usually come pre-loaded on any computer you buy. Most people use the operating system
                that comes with their computer, but it's possible to upgrade or even change operating systems. The three
                most common operating systems for personal computers are Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.<br><br>

                Modern operating systems use a graphical user interface, or GUI (pronounced gooey). A GUI lets you use
                your mouse to click icons, buttons, and menus, and everything is clearly displayed on the screen using a
                combination of graphics and text.<br><br>

                Each operating system's GUI has a different look and feel, so if you switch to a different operating
                system it may seem unfamiliar at first. However, modern operating systems are designed to be easy to
                use, and most of the basic principles are the same.<br><br>

            <h1>Kernel</h1>
            <p>
                A Kernel is a computer program that is the heart and core of an Operating System. Since the Operating
                System has control over the system so, the Kernel also has control over everything in the system. It is
                the most important part of an Operating System. Whenever a system starts, the Kernel is the first
                program that is loaded after the bootloader because the Kernel has to handle the rest of the thing of
                the system for the Operating System. The Kernel remains in the memory until the Operating System is
                shut-down.<br><br>

                The Kernel is responsible for low-level tasks such as disk management, memory management, task
                management, etc. It provides an interface between the user and the hardware components of the system.
                When a process makes a request to the Kernel, then it is called System Call.<br><br>

                A Kernel is provided with a protected Kernel Space which is a separate area of memory and this area is
                not accessible by other application programs. So, the code of the Kernel is loaded into this protected
                Kernel Space. Apart from this, the memory used by other applications is called the User Space. As these
                are two different spaces in the memory, so communication between them is a bit slower.<br><br>
            </P>

            <H2>Functions of a Kernel</H2>

            <p>
                Following are the functions of a Kernel:<br><br>

                Access Computer resource: A Kernel can access various computer resources like the CPU, I/O devices
                and other resources. It acts as a bridge between the user and the resources of the system.<br><br>

                Resource Management: It is the duty of a Kernel to share the resources between various process in
                such a way that there is uniform access to the resources by every process.<br><br>

                Memory Management: Every process needs some memory space. So, memory must be allocated and
                deallocated for its execution. All these memory management is done by a Kernel.<br><br>

                Device Management: The peripheral devices connected in the system are used by the processes. So, the
                allocation of these devices is managed by the Kernel.<br><br>
            </P>

            <h1>Processes, Threads and Concurrency</h1><br>
            <H2>What is a Process?</H2>
            <p>
                A process is the execution of a program that allows you to perform the appropriate actions specified
                in a program. It can be defined as an execution unit where a program runs. The OS helps you to
                create, schedule, and terminates the processes which is used by CPU. The other processes created by
                the main process are called child process.<br><br>

                A process operations can be easily controlled with the help of PCB(Process Control Block). You can
                consider it as the brain of the process, which contains all the crucial information related to
                processing like process id, priority, state, and contents CPU register, etc.<br><br>
            </P>

            <H2>What is Thread?</H2>

            <p>
                Thread is an execution unit that is part of a process. A process can have multiple threads, all
                executing at the same time. It is a unit of execution in concurrent programming. A thread is
                lightweight and can be managed independently by a scheduler. It helps you to improve the application
                performance using parallelism.<br><br>
            </p>

            <H2>What is concurrency?</H2>

            <p>
                Concurrency is the execution of the multiple instruction sequences at the same time. It happens in the
                operating system when there are several process threads running in parallel. The running process threads
                always communicate with each other through shared memory or message passing. Concurrency results in
                sharing of resources result in problems like deadlocks and resources starvation.
                It helps in techniques like coordinating execution of processes, memory allocation and execution
                scheduling for maximizing throughput.<br><br>
            </p>

            <h1>Storage and File Systems</h1><br>
            <H2>What is Storage?</H2>
            <p>
                Storage is a process through which digital data is saved within a data storage device by means of
                computing technology. Storage is a mechanism that enables a computer to retain data, either temporarily
                or permanently.<br><br>

                Storage devices such as flash drives and hard disks are a fundamental component of most digital devices
                since they allow users to preserve all kinds of information such as videos, documents, pictures and raw
                data.<br><br>

                Storage is among the key components of a computer system and can be classified into several forms,
                although there are two major types:<br><br>

                <b> Storage (Memory):</b> Requires a continuous supply of electricity to store/retain data. It acts as a
                computer's primary storage for temporarily storing data and handling application workloads. Examples of
                non-volatile storage include cache memory and random access memory (RAM).<br><br>

                <b> Non-Volatile Storage:</b> A type of storage mechanism that retains digital data even if it’s powered
                off or isn’t supplied with electrical power. This is often referred to as a secondary storage mechanism,
                and is used for permanent data storage requiring I/O operations. Examples of volatile storage include a
                hard disk, USB storage and optical media.<br><br>

                Storage is often confused for memory, although in computing the two terms have different meanings.
                Memory refers to short-term location of temporary data (see volatile storage above), while storage
                devices, in fact, store data on a long-term basis for later uses and access. While memory is cleared
                every time a computer is turned off, stored data is saved and stays intact until it’s manually deleted.
                Primary or volatile storage tends to me much faster than secondary storage due to its proximity to the
                processor, but it’s also comparably smaller. Secondary storage can hold and handle significantly larger
                sizes of data, and keeps it inactive until it’s needed again.<br><br>

            </p>
            <h1>What is File System</h1>
            <p>
                In a computer, a file system -- sometimes written filesystem -- is the way in which files are named and
                where they are placed logically for storage and retrieval. Without a file system, stored information
                wouldn't be isolated into individual files and would be difficult to identify and retrieve. As data
                capacities increase, the organization and accessibility of individual files are becoming even more
                important in data storage.<br><br>

                Digital file systems and files are named for and modeled after paper-based filing systems using the same
                logic-based method of storing and retrieving documents.
                File systems can differ between operating systems (OS), such as Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux-based
                systems. Some file systems are designed for specific applications. Major types of file systems include
                distributed file systems, disk-based file systems and special purpose file systems.<br><br>

            </p>
            <H2>How file systems work</H2>
            <p>
                A file system stores and organizes data and can be thought of as a type of index for all the data
                contained in a storage device. These devices can include hard drives, optical drives and flash drives.
                File systems specify conventions for naming files, including the maximum number of characters in a name,
                which characters can be used and, in some systems, how long the file name suffix can be. In many file
                systems, file names are not case sensitive.<br><br>

                Along with the file itself, file systems contain information such as the size of the file, as well as
                its attributes, location and hierarchy in the directory in the metadata. Metadata can also identify free
                blocks of available storage on the drive and how much space is available.
                A file system also includes a format to specify the path to a file through the structure of directories.
                A file is placed in a directory -- or a folder in Windows OS -- or subdirectory at the desired place in
                the tree structure. PC and mobile OSes have file systems in which files are placed somewhere in a
                hierarchical tree structure.<br><br>

                Before files and directories are created on the storage medium, partitions should be put into place. A
                partition is a region of the hard disk or other storage that the OS manages separately. One file system
                is contained in the primary partition, and some OSes allow for multiple partitions on one disk. In this
                situation, if one file system gets corrupted, the data in a different partition will be safe.

            </p>

            <img src="./photos/file-system-.jpg" alt="Storage">

            <h1>Memory</h1>
            <p>
                Computer memory is any physical device capable of storing information temporarily, like RAM (random
                access memory), or permanently, like ROM (read-only memory). Memory devices utilize integrated circuits
                and are used by operating systems, software, and hardware.<br><br>

                <b>Volatile vs. non-volatile memory</b><br>
                Memory can be either volatile and non-volatile memory. Volatile memory is memory that loses its contents
                when the computer or hardware device loses power. Computer RAM is an example of volatile memory. It is
                why if your computer freezes or reboots when working on a program, you lose anything that hasn't been
                saved. Non-volatile memory, sometimes abbreviated as NVRAM, is memory that keeps its contents even if
                the power is lost. EPROM is an example of non-volatile memory.<br><br>

                <b>Memory is not disk storage</b><br>
                It is very common for new computer users to be confused by what parts in the computer are memory.
                Although both the hard drive and RAM are memory, it's more appropriate to refer to RAM as "memory" or
                "primary memory" and a hard drive as "storage" or "secondary storage."
                When someone asks how much memory is in your computer, it is often between 1 GB and 16 GB of RAM and
                several hundred gigabytes, or even a terabyte, of hard disk drive storage. In other words, you always
                have more hard drive space than RAM.<br><br>

            </p>
            <img src="./photos/Types of Computer Memory .png" alt="memory">

            <h1>I/O Management</h1>

            <p>
                One of the important jobs of an Operating System is to manage various I/O devices including mouse,
                keyboards, touch pad, disk drives, display adapters, USB devices, Bit-mapped screen, LED,
                Analog-to-digital converter, On/off switch, network connections, audio I/O, printers etc.<br><br>

                An I/O system is required to take an application I/O request and send it to the physical device, then
                take whatever response comes back from the device and send it to the application. I/O devices can be
                divided into two categories −<br><br>

                <b>Block devices − </b> A block device is one with which the driver communicates by sending entire
                blocks of data. For example, Hard disks, USB cameras, Disk-On-Key etc.<br><br>

                <b>Character devices − </b> A character device is one with which the driver communicates by sending and
                receiving single characters (bytes, octets). For example, serial ports, parallel ports, sounds cards
                etc<br><br>

                <b>Device Controllers</b>
                Device drivers are software modules that can be plugged into an OS to handle a particular device.
                Operating System takes help from device drivers to handle all I/O devices.<br><br>

                The Device Controller works like an interface between a device and a device driver. I/O units (Keyboard,
                mouse, printer, etc.) typically consist of a mechanical component and an electronic component where
                electronic component is called the device controller.<br><br>

                There is always a device controller and a device driver for each device to communicate with the
                Operating Systems. A device controller may be able to handle multiple devices. As an interface its main
                task is to convert serial bit stream to block of bytes, perform error correction as necessary.<br><br>

                Any device connected to the computer is connected by a plug and socket, and the socket is connected to a
                device controller. Following is a model for connecting the CPU, memory, controllers, and I/O devices
                where CPU and device controllers all use a common bus for communication.<br><br>

            <h1>Virtualization & Cloud Computing</h1><br><br>
            <h2>What is virtualization?</h2>

            <p>
                Virtualization is the process of running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer abstracted
                from the actual hardware. Most commonly, it refers to running multiple operating systems on a computer
                system simultaneously. To the applications running on top of the virtualized machine, it can appear as
                if they are on their own dedicated machine, where the operating system, libraries, and other programs
                are unique to the guest virtualized system and unconnected to the host operating system which sits below
                it.<br><br>

                There are many reasons why people utilize virtualization in computing. To desktop users, the most common
                use is to be able to run applications meant for a different operating system without having to switch
                computers or reboot into a different system. For administrators of servers, virtualization also offers
                the ability to run different operating systems, but perhaps, more importantly, it offers a way to
                segment a large system into many smaller parts, allowing the server to be used more efficiently by a
                number of different users or applications with different needs. It also allows for isolation, keeping
                programs running inside of a virtual machine safe from the processes taking place in another virtual
                machine on the same host.<br><br>
            </p>

            <h2>What is cloud computing?</h2>

            <p>
                Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases,
                networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster
                innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you
                use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your
                business needs change.<br><br>

                <b>Top benefits of cloud computing</b><br>
                Cloud computing is a big shift from the traditional way businesses think about IT resources. Here are
                seven common reasons organizations are turning to cloud computing services:<br><br>

                <b>Cost</b><br>
                Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and
                running on-site datacenters—the racks of servers, the round-the-clock electricity for power and cooling,
                and the IT experts for managing the infrastructure. It adds up fast.<br><br>

                <b>Global scale</b><br>
                The benefits of cloud computing services include the ability to scale elastically. In cloud speak, that
                means delivering the right amount of IT resources—for example, more or less computing power, storage,
                bandwidth—right when they’re needed, and from the right geographic location.<br><br>

                <b>Performance</b><br>
                The biggest cloud computing services run on a worldwide network of secure datacenters, which are
                regularly upgraded to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware. This offers
                several benefits over a single corporate datacenter, including reduced network latency for applications
                and greater economies of scale.<br><br>

                <b>Security</b><br>
                Many cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies, and controls that strengthen your
                security posture overall, helping protect your data, apps, and infrastructure from potential
                threats.<br><br>

                <b>Speed</b><br>
                Most cloud computing services are provided self service and on demand, so even vast amounts of computing
                resources can be provisioned in minutes, typically with just a few mouse clicks, giving businesses a lot
                of flexibility and taking the pressure off capacity planning.<br><br>

                <b>Productivity</b><br>
                On-site datacenters typically require a lot of “racking and stacking”—hardware setup, software patching,
                and other time-consuming IT management chores. Cloud computing removes the need for many of these tasks,
                so IT teams can spend time on achieving more important business goals.<br><br>

                <b>Reliability</b><br>
                Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity easier and less expensive
                because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network.<br><br>
